# FlappyBirdClone

Into the deep end with game development!  In an effort to get properly started with game dev and to stop making excuses, I've decided to make clones of some common and fairly popular games and game genres.  For the 2D portion, I have decided to work with the Godot engine as it seems to be a very friendly environment, open source, free, and fun to use.  This is the second game I've made on the engine, and this time I've decided to make a Flappy Bird clone.
